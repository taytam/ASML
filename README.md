ASML (Automated Sentry Missile Launcher)
=========================================

This application was written for Cpts 323 Software Design at WSU Tri-Cities

By: Taylor Tamblin, Zachary Breitenstein, and Cody Curry

Project Information
===========================

This software works on Windows systems (tested on Windows 7) with the Dream Cheeky USB Thunder Missile Launcher.

This software was written using the C# language in Visual Studio 2012.

Using This Software
============================

The purpose of this software is to control the Dream Cheeky Launcher in one of two ways:

Automated - Given a set of coordinates in a .ini or .xml file, the launcher will fire missiles at the specified location.  The coordinates entered will be in x,y,z format.

Manual - Our software offers a manual mode so the user can adjust the aim of the launcher and fire manually.
